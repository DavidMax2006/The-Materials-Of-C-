# The Materials Of C++
This repository is for C++ beginners.

## How to use These Codes?
If you're a beginner, you may met these **problems**:

- Don't have `Appropriate tutorials`;

- Don't have `Appropriate editor`;

- Wrong Codes

- And more....

In fact, there're many problems you **must solve**!

If you're lost in the C++ Forest, you can study these codes to **know how to get started**!

> You can use *Atom*  to open these codes, remember, **C++'s format is .cpp**!

And if you want to run these codes, you can download plugin *gcc-make-run* in `Install`.

![gcc-make-run](https://i.loli.net/2019/03/02/5c79dbede7a45.png)

Wait the plugin download finished, open one .cpp file, and press <kbd>F6</kbd> to make and run itï¼ˆ**Just for C++, gcc and Makefile**).

There's a notice: **If you want to code, Linux is the best**, you can use Centos 7 or Ubuntu something.

*Atom* has lots of coding plugins just like *Sublime Text*, now show you some functional plugins:

### Emmet
Well, it's just like *zen-coding*, **you can autocomplete and make Snippets at HTML, CSS, or something about design website**, it's really powerful!

You just write easy and fast code, then press <kbd>Tab</kbd>,and *Emmet* will create and design the Snippets.
